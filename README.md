# olp-2-test

Description
-----------
Vue app to catalog and sell a subset of courses for the university. Spun up with Vue CLI. A lot of plugins aren't supporting Vue 3 yet, so I'm doing a lot of things "the Vue 2 way". It utilizes an admin panel to input dynamic course content into a firebase instance, which also manages users.

Upcoming Features
--------------
Hope to implement cart and user profile features as well as process payments and enroll students.


How to build
----------
```
npm run build

_grip it and rip it_
